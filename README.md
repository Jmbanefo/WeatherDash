# WeatherDash

The goal of this challenge is to create a weather dashboard that displays the current and 5 day forecast for a particular city. A third party API called OpenWeather was used to access data with the use of Fetch requests. The user can see the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon for specific dates. There is also a running history of the previous searches that can be used to quickly call information that was already presented.
